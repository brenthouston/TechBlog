## Description
   This is an app that tech enthusiasts can use to share interesting facts about tech. The user can create a password, profile, and posts to share with the tech community. Also you can make comments on Posts.  I learned how to create a full stack application and deploy via heroku. My file structure is set up in the standard MVC format. This was a great app to make.
